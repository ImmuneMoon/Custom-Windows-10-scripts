# VS Code Docker & EXE Deployment Hotkey Mod: `build.deploy.run`

---

## âœ… Why `build.deploy.run`

- **Neutral**: Not tied to any single project or joke
- **Descriptive**: Mirrors the actual sequence
- **Extendable**: Works for Python, Node, Docker, whatever
- **Clean UI**: Presents well in VS Code as `> Build: Deploy: Run`

---

## âš¡ Access tasks.json Instantly in VS Code
### ðŸ’£ What This Does

    Works whether it lives in:

        - Project root or

        - Quick_Docker_n_EXE_Build_n_Deploy/

    Finds the project root based on the presence of /venv

    Copies:

        -keybindings.json

        - tasks.json â€¦into the .vscode/ folder automatically

    Prints a clean confirmation message

    Leaves VS Code ready to deploy via Ctrl+Alt+D (or your chosen hotkey)

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use It

  - Put this .bat anywhere inside your repo

  - Run it once

  - VS Code gets the right task and keybinding config

  - Now just hit Ctrl+Alt+D in the editor to trigger the deployer

**Faster than Docker can pretend it's starting.**

## ðŸ§  Next Step: Full Extension Plan

### `.vsix` extension:
  ```json
  "command": "build.deploy.run"
```

And wire it up to a button or status bar item for instant access â€” with custom output panel, icons, logging, and total command over your build rituals.

Excellent move â€” don't bind a universal deploy mechanism to a single, pun-ridden project name. That's how tech debt gets a nickname.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Naming Criteria:

- Neutral, reusable, clean
- Still sounds like it hurts when used wrong
- Easy to extend across future projects

---

## ðŸ”¥ Stacks to be considered

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `deploy.stack` | Deploy the full stack â€” sounds technical, not trendy |
| `build.deploy.run` | Describes the action chain precisely |
| `zero.deploy` | Implies zero config, zero excuses |
| `launch.protocol` | Sounds military, fits well as a button |
| `compile.contain.execute` | Brutal, descriptive, and unambiguous |
| `summon.deployment` | For extra flair, like youâ€™re invoking a daemon |

---

### âœ… Strongest candidate:
> **`build.deploy.run`**  
Short, semantic, and universal. Doesnâ€™t reek of branding. Feels like a pipeline.

---

When you're ready to spin this into an actual extension, we name the command:
  ```json
  "command": "build.deploy.run"
```

And the user will see:
```
  > Build: Deploy: Run
```

Clean. Modular. Not cute.

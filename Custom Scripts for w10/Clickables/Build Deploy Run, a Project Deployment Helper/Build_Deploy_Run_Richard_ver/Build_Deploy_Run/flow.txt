it should:
for dev, allow me to compile this to an exe, that i give to the user
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THE EXE SHOULD:
>have a gui that allows the user to select their xwindows, docker, and project file
>use icon.ico in 'assets' in the main directory as a icon

THE GUI:
>should have an option to open the project file for them as a checkbox somewhere.
>have a dark theme
>have a terminal output somewhere for the user to see the install status
>incorporate the icon.ico and icon.png
>icon.ico should be used for the window icon, as mentioned above
>icon.png should be incorprated somewhere in the window
>should install build deploy run folder to project

WHILE INSTALLER GUI INSTALLS, IT SHOULD:
>create env in build deploy run folder from requirements only in that folder, NOT IN THE USERS DIRECTORY YET
>save user settings with env in build deploy run folder, and only there. not the parent folder of the user's project. they only need to be referenced from the folder logic anyways
>check for, virtual env and exe and docker deployment in dist, IN THE USERS PROJECT DIRECTORY. PROJECT/dist/exe or PROJECT/ Docker bullshit
>if THE EXE AND DOCKER DEPLOYMENT ALREADY EXIST, ignore, theyll be overwritten later
>check for env IN THE USERS DIRECTORY just to be safe
>delete project env, if there is one, but confirm to the user first, if they say no, skip that
>continue after otherwise
>otherwise (if there was none or there was and the user selected yes, it has been replaced with a fresh copy for a good deploy
>make new env IN THE USERS DIRECTORY, FOR MAKING A EXE AND DOCKER WITH DURING USER CLI USE
>deposit the build deploy run files needed for the program to work
>optionally, open xwindows, docker, and or project folder, if option is selected

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
After install is finished, GUI PRESENTS THE USER WITH A CLI CODE TO RUN IN THEIR PROJECT FOLDER, 
that CLI line is COPIED TO THE USERS CLIPBOARD. After the user confirms the message, and THE GUI EXITS 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

>user places/ pastes: .\Build_Deploy_Run\build_and_deploy_venv_locked.bat in cli and presses enter

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE USER INSTALLED PROGRAM SHOULD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

>when the cli is used, or launch button is hit, it should launch the newly created or previously existing env that is exclusively for the use of the deployer they are utilizing
>generate EXE/Docker for the user
>generate a new requirements if their current is innacurate
>after finished, THE ENV SHOULD EXIT

if ran again, the env opens, the program does its job, closes env
